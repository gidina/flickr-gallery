PRÀCTICA:

You will need to develop a gallery widget similar to https://codepen.io/nakome/pen/sIcin 

Specs: 

The gallery must load images from Flickr's API. 

The gallery should be able to show the owner's username, which points to the original image post and the image caption. 

On image click, a responsive lightbox should beopened with all image information that you can include. 

The gallery should paginate between different image sets. 

Important: 

We use React. You can use whatever you want. If it's React you'll have extra points ☺ 

Code quality is important for us, so take care of how you structure it and keep an eye on JavaScript best practices. 

Commit your progress: you can use github, gitlab or bitbucket, simply share the repository with us. 

Documentation, Unit Testing, Functional Testing if you consider relevant for the exercise. 

Extra points: 

Make the gallery responsive. 

Asynchronous image load treatment. 

Remember to create a README.md file and describe any decisions you take during the implementation that can help us understand your reasoning. 

Note: Please, don’t use create-react-app to the backend, bootstrap to the css or a similar frameworks to precomplete the task, this test is to see your way or code ☺

Buen fin de semana! Saludos
